### About
A brief summary of what I read about recently.

### Kubernetes VS Docker
1. Container: Containers and container platforms provide a lot more advantages over traditional virtualization. Isolation is done on the kernel level without the need for a guest operating system, so containers are much more efficient, fast, and lightweight. Allowing for applications to become encapsulated in self-contained environments comes with a slew of advantages, such as quicker deployments, scalability, and closer parity between development environments.
2. Docker is currently the most popular container platform.
3. Kubernetes, Mesos, and Docker Swarm are some of the more popular options for providing an abstraction to make a cluster of machines behave like one big machine, which is vital in a large-scale environment.
    - How would all of these containers be coordinated and scheduled? 
    - How do all the different containers in your application communicate with each other? 
    - How can container instances be scaled?

### DGraph

### Random thoughts about auto-drive
Is there protocol for inter-car communication (inter-auto-car, inter-auto-normal-car)? Similarly, car to human? Security for internet of cars (DDoS attack)?
