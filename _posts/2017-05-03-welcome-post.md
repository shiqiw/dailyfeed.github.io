Well, finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

A few pitfalls to avoid in day 1:
- Naming of the personal website should strictly follow username.github.io if using github to build personal website, otherwise you'll gladly bump into 404. (Also, please wait for 5-10 minutes before giving up trying and believing you have made a mistake.)
- Don't confuse yourself about github website page layout with Jekyll directory layout. (But they are confusing, I admit.)
- Install Jekyll on your machine. (Personally I do not like making a bunch of commits just for debugging...)
- Last but not the least, continue working.
