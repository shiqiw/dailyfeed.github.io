### Goal
In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

### Adapeter pattern
The adapter pattern is a design pattern that is used to allow two incompatible types to communicate. (Correlated design principal: dependency inversion)

### Bridge pattern
A design pattern that separates the abstract elements of a class from its technical implementation. This provides a cleaner implementation of real-world objects and allows the implementation details to be changed easily.

On of the biggest benefits of Bridge pattern is ability to change implementation details at run time. This could permit the user to switch implementations to determine how the software interoperates with other systems.

### Composite pattern
A design pattern that is used when creating hierarchical object models. The pattern defines a manner in which to design recursive tree structures of objects, where individual objects and groups can be accessed in the same manner.
