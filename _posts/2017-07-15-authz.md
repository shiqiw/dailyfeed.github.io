### Claim-based authentication
Isolated identity service

### ASP.NET auth flow (Using OWIN)

*Purpose*

Create an abstraction between Web servers and framework components.

Without OWIN, the asp.net bits are coupled to the way IIS communicates with the application. OWIN abstracts web servers and framework components. That means that your application code will now be aware of the OWIN interface, but not of the webserver that is serving the request.

*Some implementation details*
1. IIdentity
2. IPrincipal
3. Application delegate dictionary

4. CookieAuthenticationMiddleware (AuthenticateCoreAsync and ApplyResponseGrantAsync)

*User steps*

0. Configure auth in Startup
1. Find user
2. Create user identity
3. AuthManager signin
