## What is it
The analytics.js library is a JavaScript library for measuring how users interact with your website. The data that can be captured include:
- the total time a user spends on your site
- the time a user spends on each page and in what order those pages were visited
- what internal links were clicked (based on the URL of the next pageview).
- the geographic location of the user.
- what browser and operating system are being used.
- screen size and whether Flash or Java is installed.
- the referring site.

## How to use it
The JavaScript tracking snippet code should be added near the top of the <head> tag and before any other script or CSS tags, and the string 'UA-XXXXX-Y' should be replaced with the property ID (also called the "tracking ID") of the Google Analytics property you wish to track.
